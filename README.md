emojidex Chrome Extension
=========================
An extension for Chrome/Chromium and derivative browsers that adds emojidex emojification 
to pages and an emoji pallete to the tool bar.

==========
You can find a stable version of emojidex on the Chrome Web Store 
[here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emojidex/dmjimhgmfmldekckbojggjdijpollpeg?hl=ja)
.  
  
To install a development version you'll need to enable developer mode in Chrome/Chromium and load 
a build of the extension. Build instructions can be found below in the "Development" section, 
but assuming you have sucessfully run the build scripts you can load the extension locally by 
following [this](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) section of the 
Chrome Extension development guide.
